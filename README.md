# LAB: Group Visualizations and ETL Reports
 
## Introduction
In this lab, you will work in groups to transform data, create visualizations, create an ETL report, review peer ETL reports, and present your findings to the class.

## Part 1: Question Your Data
Your instructor has created four breakout rooms titled: Economy & Growth, Financial Sector, Health, and Social Development.

1. Choose your breakout room (no more than six learners per room).
2. Go to World Bank indicators and select the dataset that corresponds to your breakout room name.
3. Identify at least four questions you want to answer about your data.
## Part 2: Cleaning
Clean the data associated with your breakout room.

## Part 3: ETL Report
Create an ETL report that details the steps you took to clean your data. You can use the ETL Report Guide as a template.

## Part 4: Trade Reports
Once everyone has created their reports:

1. Trade your report with another group.
2. Replicate the ETL steps identified in the report you received from another group.
3. Provide feedback if you found any of the steps difficult or impossible to replicate.
## Part 5: Create Visualizations
Create visualizations that answer the questions you identified in Part 1.

## Part 6: Presentations
Present your findings to the class.
